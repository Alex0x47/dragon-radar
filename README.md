# dragon-radar

### I don't plan to publish this app on stores ! I'm just working on this project on my spare time for fun and to show what I can do !

The Dragon Radar is, in Dragon Ball, a tiny radar used to find the 7 dragon balls, wich are needed to invoke Shenron who can acoomplish wishes.

This app is made with React Native. The goal is to reproduce a Dragon Radar. The design of the manga's radar should be the same. A map with a green background, the user represented by a red triangle, and 7 points representing the 7 dragon balls.

All of these with will be drawn on the screen using user's geolocation.
When the user get close to a Dragon Ball, they get it. The goal is to take the 7 dragon balls.

### This project started in August 2019. As i work on it on my spare time, it grows slowly and I'm not even sure I'll finish it, so please, don't judge me :)
